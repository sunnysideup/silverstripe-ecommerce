Right now, we are using the following strategy for the JS files (these are not rules, just a strategy open to improvement):

- All files are named Ecom{mynamegoeshere}
- We do not worry that there are a fair few files, they can always be put into one using the Requirements::combine_files method.
- All files contain one variable Ecom{mynamegoeshere}, which has several functions and variables.
- The code will usually be kicked into action by jQuery(document).ready(bla bla).
