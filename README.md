## Installation Instructions ##

There are no special tricks to install this module. Install like any
other Silverstripe Module module.

### Cronjobs
If you need to defer any of the OrderSteps (delay by x seconds) then you
need to set up a cron job as follows:

```bash
* * * * * php /root/folder/of/website/framework/cli-script.php  dev/tasks/EcommerceTaskProcessOrderQueue
```
To use SSL on some pages only, you can define:

DEFINE('_SECURE_URL', "https://www.mysite.co.nz");

DEFINE('_STANDARD_URL', "http://www.mysite.co.nz");

## Development Philosophy and Version Management ##

This flavour of Silvertripe E-commerce aims to be a polished, one click install solution for basic e-commerce websites.

We are in the process of moving towards semantic versioning.

## Features ##

 * 40+ sub-modules available (varying quality levels, but plenty of inspiration and example code ;-))

 * extensive dev tools:
  - bundled under dev/ecommerce/ (e.g. www.mysite.co.nz/dev/ecommerce/
  - full list of all configs (~70) available through wizard like interface
  - install complete test site within two minutes (as per previous e-mail)
  - example front-end template showing nearly all variables available and how to use them
  - javascript code included (e.g. ajaxifies cart)
  - basic customisation guide: http://www.silverstripe-ecommerce.com/home/customisation-guide/
  - lots of helpful maintenance and debug scripts
  - add /debug to the end of a product / product category URL (e.g. www.mysite.co.nz/my-product/debug/ to get all the coding info you may need for that object - e.g. SQL to select products in product category)

 * cart responses are easily customised / ajaxified and will update all identified areas on any page view

 * ability to use
  (a) no account (i.e. guest checkout),
  (b) must have account, or
  (c) account optional.
  This is one of the major e-com discussion points with clients. We have tried to cater for all three scenarios.

 * super flexible order process with customisable OrderModifiers and OrderSteps:

  - OrderModifiers add/deduct cost, products, etc... before placing the final order (e.g. tax, delivery, discounts)

  - OrderSteps do stuff after order is placed (e.g. email invoice, update stock, ping another API, etc... ) - kudos to Jeremy Shipman for promoting this concept

 * supports multi-currency

 * emails look great thanks to emogrifier e-mail formatting

 * we aim to have polished CMS views.

 * very flexible and powerful product categories:

  - extensive caching makes the product lists very fast, even with 1000s of products.

  - some smart features such as "previous" and "next" product links (based on last list shown),

  - built-in search, with ability to search within category, previous search, or entire product range

  - one product can be in many product categories

  - extensive filter and sort options (customisable through yml)

 * ability to use RESTFUL service API for connecting with third-party software

 * ability to create country specific pricing (requires custom code)

 * we are starting to use semantic versioning

 * can use Omnipay (code can be made available), although there are also a number of other payment gateways available (DPS, Paypal, etc...)

 * we are super happy to help anyone to get started with version of e-commerce

 * we would welcome financial support and other help to add
  (a) translations
  (b) test suite


## Now you mention it ... where the hell are the Unit Tests? ##

Right now, ecommerce does not have any php unit tests.
This is a major shortcoming that will be set right in due course.
We welcome contributions and/or donations to make this happen.
