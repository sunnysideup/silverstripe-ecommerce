Can it be fixed by a setting in the Database?:
  Update database fields using the CMS.:
    - Go to http://www.mysite.com/admin/shop/ and check settings.
    - Create required pages such as the OrderConfirmation Page.
    - Check fields for e-commerce pages (e.g. messages on the Checkout Page)

Is it a wording change?:
  Create your own language file and add your own translation.:
    - Do a search for the text in your source code to see how to replace it.
    - What is your default AND current user locale?
    - Create new folder "z" with config folder in it, add "lang" directory with "_manifest_exclude" file.
    - In the lang directory add the required translation file(s) - see <a href="https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-cms/tree/3.1/lang">cms/lang/</a> for examples.
    - 'Also see <a href="http://docs.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/i18n">http://docs.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/i18n</a>'

Can it be fixed by changing the config files?:
  Create and update mysite/_config/ecommerce.yml:
    - Go to http://www.mysite.com/dev/ecommerce/ecommercetaskcheckconfiguration and carefully review options.
    - Check ecommerce/_config.php and the ecommerce/config/ folder for further ideas.
    - Update mysite/_config/ecommerce.yml with the required settings.  Bear in mind, that by default, arrays settings are added to any existing array elements.  To replace an array outright, use Config::inst()->update("MyClassName", "my_variable_as_array", $newArray);.

Can it be fixed with CSS:
  Theme appropriate CSS file and change:
    - Check the page html source head section to see what CSS files are used - theme (move a copy to /themes/mytheme_ecommerce/css) and adjust file as required.
    - Try to "Theme" the most appropriate CSS file. If that does not work, use Requirements::block(oldFile) and add Requirements::css(newFileIncludingPath) or Requirements::themedCSS(newFileCode).
    - For more information on themeing, visit - <a href="http://docs.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/theme-development">http://docs.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/theme-development</a>.

Can it be fixed with Javascript (JS):
  Update JS variables or replace JS files:
    - 'All the JS files contain JSON objects (<q>var MyVar = { .... }; </q>). You can replace variables and methods within those JSON objects by adding a bit of Javascript like this: <q>myVar.sizeOfSomething = 111</q> or <q>myVar.myJavascriptFunction = function(){....}</q>. This is a very easy and powerful way to change an existing JS library.'
    - Use Requirements::block(existingFileIncludingPath) and add Requirements::javascript(newFileIncludingPath) to replace entire JS files.
    - Add new JS files.
    - Requirement calls are often made in the Page_Controller::init method of a Controller or in a onBeforeInit and onAfterInit of an Extensions class that extends a Controller.

Can it be fixed by adjusting the HTML?:
  Theme appropriate template file (.ss) and change as needed.:
    - Check the source to see what HTML files are used (add Config::inst()->update("SSViewer", "source_file_comments", true); to your _config.php file.
    - "Theme" the most appropriate HTML template (.ss) file - use 'unthemed" file as starting point and check the relevant Controllers for available "Controls". Only theme what is needed.
    - For more information on themeing, visit - <a href="http://docs.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/theme-development">http://docs.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/theme-development</a>.

Is there a sub-module that can add the functionality you are looking for?:
  Install sub-module.:
    - Visit <a href="http://addons.silverstripe.org/">http://addons.silverstripe.org/</a> or visit <a href="https://github.com/sunnysideup?tab=repositories">https://github.com/sunnysideup?tab=repositories</a> to find a module that suits.
    - Install as per usual - making sure that the versions match.

Do you want to add a discount / charge / tax other crazy thing that is dependent on the content of the order?:
  Create a class that extends OrderModifier.:
    - Look at the example modifier - <a href="https://github.com/sunnysideup/silverstripe-ecommerce_modifier_example">example modifier</a> to get some ideas.
    - Make sure to add the modifier in the mysite/_config/ecommerce.yml file in the Order.modifiers variable.
    - If your OrderModifier includes any options (e.g. see /ecommerce_tax/code/model/GSTTaxModifierOptions.php) then add to StoreAdmin (using /mysite/_config/ecommerce.yml)

Do you want to change the lists / display / functionality of products?:
  Extend the ProductVariation / Product / ProductGroup class.:
    - Extend the ProductVariation / Product / ProductGroup class and make sure to have a good look through any of these three classes that you are extending.
    - In the ProductGroup class you can decide exactly what products you like to show in what sort of lists, with what filters, etc...
    - Add static $hide_ancestor = "Product(Group)" to hide the default Product(Group).
    - If you need to, you can also extend the relevant OrderItem (e.g. MyProduct_OrderItem extends Product_OrderItem)
    - This option is the most likely and easiest way to make substantial changes to e-commerce without having to edit the core. There are lots more options, but it is recommended to start here.

Do you want to add a new type of product that does not suit Product or Product Variation?:
  Create your own "Buyable" class.:
    - Make sure you use the BuyableInterface (e.g. MyBuyable extends DataObject implements BuyableInterface), which will help you add the right "methods" (functions) to your custom Buyable Class.
    - Make sure to update ecommerce.yml with the additional Buyable.

Do you want to add a general note to your order that is not dependent on the items added to the order?:
  Create an Order Status Log.:
    - Have a look at /ecommerce/code/model/process/ to see what OrderStatusLog classes are included by default.
    - Explore the e-commerce sub-modules for more examples.
    - Add MyOrderStatusLog to /mysite/_config/ecommerce.yml file in the OrderStatusLog.available_log_classes_array variable.
    - Also, OrderStatusLogs are not added automatically, so you will need to use an OrderStep to create them. Again, the core code will provide some good examples.

Do you want to change something in the Order Process? E.g. sending an extra e-mail, beaming the order to a third-party app or just shortening the process.:
  Add / Edit / Remove any of the OrderSteps.:
    - Check /admin/shop (Order Steps), to see what you can add/edit/delete without coding.
    - Open /ecommerce/code/model/process/ in your code and look at the OrderStep classes created here. Find the one that is closes to what you want to do and create your own class - MyOrderStep extends OrderStep. Make sure to review the core methods.
    - Add MyOrderStep to /mysite/_config/ecommerce.yml file in the OrderStep.order_steps_to_include variable.

Do you want to customise the emails that are sent to customers after placing an order?:
  Edit Email Templates and/or OrderSteps:
    - "The easiest way to change an email is to adjust the css. The location for the CSS is specified in the config file (see - http://www.mysite.com/dev/ecommerce/ecommercecheckconfiguration to see where the config file lives). The setting is: Order_Email.css_file_location. The file specified here is automatically included inline, using the emogrifier extension."
    - One email can be sent per orderstep. Review OrderStep_SentInvoice (in /code/model/process/OrderStep.php) for an example of how an orderstep sends an email. You may add / remove ordersteps to change emails (see topic on OrderSteps in this document).
    - You may want to create a class that extends OrderEmail (see /code/email/Order_Email.php and examples in the same folder).
    - Of course you can theme (see themeing topic) any of the templates that are used in the Emails (see templates/emails/)
    - Nice to know - any use of [OrderNumber] in the email template will be replaced with the Order.ID (e.g. 134)

Do you want a different payment method?:
  Create your own payment class.:
    - There are plenty of Payment Class examples out there... Create your own class and add a reference to it in your /mysite/_config/config.yml file.

Can you extend a class to achieve your result?:
  Use the standard MyClass extends CoreClass and override any methods and variables you want changed.:
    - See <a href="http://docs.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/datamodel">http://docs.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/datamodel</a> for more information.

Can a class "decorator" / "extension" sort out your worries?:
  Add a decorator / extension.:
    - Within the e-commerce code, we have added a number of "hooks", they often look like this - $this->extend or similar... you can use these "hooks" to change the actions and outputs of core methods.
    - See <a href="http://docs.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/datamodel">http://docs.silverstripe.org/framework/en/topics/datamodel</a> for more information.

Can you create a custom class that replaces the core class?:
  Create custom class to replace a core one.:
    - Create your custom class and add the following to your mysite/_config.php file - Object::useCustomClass('CoreClass','MyClass'); .
    - The e-commerce module has been written in such a way that the core class should be replaced by your own class. Make sure that the methods available are identical (use in interface where available).
    - In some cases, the designated core class can be selected in the /mysite/_config/ecommerce.yml.

Can you hack the core to make it work?:
  Make a fork on Github and start hacking away.:
    - A fork on github is the preferred method here.
    - If you are using SVN, you can look at Piston as a solution.

Still not working?:
